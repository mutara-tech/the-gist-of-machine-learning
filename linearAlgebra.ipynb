    "# Introduction to linear algebra\n",
    "**What is linear algebra?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that is widely used throughout science and engineering. \n",
    "- Linear algebra is a form of continuous rather than discrete mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why study linear algebra?**\n",
    "- A good understanding of linear algebra is essential for understanding and workingwith many machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms.\n",
    "The study of linear algebra involves several types of mathematical objects namely ***Scalars, Vectors, Matrices and Tensors***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalars**:\n",
    "  - A scalar is a single number, unlike other objects in linear algebra which are arrays of multiple numbers.\n",
    "  - Scalars are written in italics.\n",
    "  - Typically given lowercase variable names.\n",
    "  - When introduced, the type of number they represent is specified.\n",
    "  - Example notations:\n",
    "    - \\( $ \\textit{s} $  $ \\in $ $ \\mathbb{R} \\ $): \n",
    "      - \\( $ \\in \\ $) means \"belongs to\" or \"is an element of\".\n",
    "      - \\( $ \\mathbb{R} \\ $) is the set of real numbers.\n",
    "        - **Real Numbers**: They include both rational and irrational numbers, and can be positive, negative, or zero.\n",
    "    - \\( $ \\textit{n} $ $ \\in $ $\\mathbb{N} \\ $): \n",
    "      - \\( $ \\mathbb{N} \\ $) is the set of natural numbers.\n",
    "        - **Natural Numbers**: They are a set of positive integers starting from 1, and include numbers like 1, 2, 3, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vectors**:\n",
    "  - A vector is an array of numbers that are arranged in order.\n",
    "  - Individual numbers in the vector can be identified by their index.\n",
    "  - Vectors are typically named in lowercase bold typeface, e.g., **x**.\n",
    "  - Elements of a vector are identified using the vector's name in italic typeface followed by a subscript.\n",
    "    - First element: \\( $ x_1 $ \\)\n",
    "    - Second element: \\( $ x_2 $ \\)\n",
    "    - and so on.\n",
    "  - The type of numbers in the vector is important.\n",
    "    - If each element belongs to \\( $ \\mathbb{R} $ \\) and the vector has \\( $ n $ \\) elements, then the vector belongs to \\( $ \\mathbb{R}^n $ \\).\n",
    "      - \\( $ \\mathbb{R}^n $ \\) represents the Cartesian product of \\( $ \\mathbb{R} $ \\) taken \\( $ n $ \\) times.\n",
    "  - Explicit representation of a vector:\n",
    "    - \\( $ x = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_n \\end{bmatrix} $ \\)\n",
    "  - Vectors can represent points in space, with each element indicating a coordinate along a different axis.\n",
    "  - Indexing a set of vector elements:\n",
    "    - Define a set with indices and use it as a subscript.\n",
    "      - E.g., for elements \\( $ x_1 $ \\), \\( $ x_3 $ \\), and \\( $ x_6 $ \\), define set \\( $ S = \\{1, 3, 6\\} $ \\) and write \\( $ x_S $ \\).\n",
    "    - Use the \\( - \\) sign to index the complement of a set.\n",
    "      - \\( $ x_{-1} $ \\) contains all elements of \\( $ x $ \\) except \\( $ x_1 $ \\).\n",
    "      - \\( $ x_{-S} $ \\) contains all elements of \\( $ x $ \\) except those indexed by set \\( $ S $ \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrices**:\n",
    "  - A matrix is a 2-D array of numbers.\n",
    "    - Each element in the matrix is identified by two indices.\n",
    "  - Matrices are typically given uppercase variable names in bold typeface, e.g., **A**.\n",
    "  - If a real-valued matrix \\( $ \\mathbf{A} $ \\) has a height of \\($ m $\\) and a width of \\($ n $\\), then:\n",
    "    - \\( $ \\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n} $ \\).\n",
    "  - Elements of a matrix are identified by its name in italic, with the indices separated by commas.\n",
    "    - Top-left entry: \\( $ A_{1,1} $ \\)\n",
    "    - Bottom-right entry: \\( $ A_{m,n} $ \\)\n",
    "  - Special indexing using the colon (:):\n",
    "    - \\( $ A_{i,:}  $\\): The \\($ i $\\)-th row of \\($ \\mathbf{A} $\\).\n",
    "    - \\( $ A_{:,i}  $\\): The \\($ i $\\)-th column of \\($ \\mathbf{A} $ \\).\n",
    "  - Explicit representation of a matrix:\n",
    "    - \\( $ \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} A_{1,1} & A_{1,2} \\\\ A_{2,1} & A_{2,2} \\end{bmatrix} $ \\)\n",
    "  - Indexing matrix-valued expressions with more than one character:\n",
    "    - Use subscripts after the expression without converting to lowercase.\n",
    "      - Example: \\( $f( \\mathbf{A})_{i,j} $ \\) refers to the \\($ (i, j) $\\)-th element of the matrix obtained by applying function \\($ f $ \\) to \\( $\\mathbf{A} $\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tensors**:\n",
    "  - Tensors are arrays of numbers arranged on a regular grid with a variable number of axes.\n",
    "  - Generally used when data requires more than two axes.\n",
    "  - A tensor named **A** can be denoted with this typeface: **A**.\n",
    "  - Elements of a tensor are identified by its name and coordinates.\n",
    "    - For example, the element at coordinates \\( $(i, j, k)$ \\) is represented as:\n",
    "      - \\( $ A_{i,j,k} $ \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transposing**:\n",
    "  - The transpose of a matrix creates its mirror image across the main diagonal.\n",
    "  - Denoted as \\( $ A^T $ \\).\n",
    "    - For matrix \\($ A $\\), the transpose is defined as: \\( $(A^T)_{i,j} = A_{j,i}$ \\).\n",
    "  - Vectors, being matrices with one column, can also be transposed to become a one-row matrix.\n",
    "    - Example: \\($ x = [x_1, x_2, x_3]^T $\\).\n",
    "  - For scalars, the scalar is its own transpose: \\($ a = a^T $\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrix Addition and Scalar Operations**:\n",
    "  - Matrices can be added if they have the same shape: \\($ C = A + B $\\) where \\($ C_{i,j} = A_{i,j} + B_{i,j} $\\).\n",
    "  - Scalar operations with matrices:\n",
    "    - Addition: Each element of the matrix is increased by the scalar.\n",
    "    - Multiplication: Each element of the matrix is multiplied by the scalar.\n",
    "      - Example: \\($ D = a \\cdot B + c $\\) where \\( $D_{i,j} = a \\cdot B_{i,j} + c $\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Learning Conventions**:\n",
    "  - Addition of a matrix and a vector results in a matrix: \\($ C = A + b $\\).\n",
    "    - Here, the vector \\($ b $\\) is added to each row of \\($ A $\\).\n",
    "  - The process where \\($ b $\\) is implicitly copied to multiple locations is termed **broadcasting**."
